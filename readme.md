# Polymorphism in Java
This brief example shows Polymorphism which is the ability of objects to take different forms.

 In this example we are exploring dangerous plant species - namely _Cactus_, _Tree_ and _FloweringPlant_. These species are all a subclass of the abstract class _Plant_. _Plant_ has the abstract method *canHurtYou()* and because of inheritance and polymorphism, implementations of this method can vary dependent on the different sub-classes. 
 
 Some plants have spines, some have poisonous fruits and others are poisonous themselves. By using polymorphism we can treat them all as "Plants" despite their varying implementations.
